\title{Get nominal timepoints based on vector of timepoints}
\usage{
get_nominal_timepoints(t, adjust = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{vector of timepoints}

\item{adjust}{sensitivity for peaks in the density curve to detect nominal
timepoints. A factor of 0.5 often works well for PK data.}

\item{...}{optional arguments passed to \code{stats::density} function in addition
to \code{adjust}, e.g \code{bw}. The easiest way to adjust the sensitivity to peaks in
the data is to use \code{adjust}.}
}
\value{
a vector of approximate nominal timepoints estimated from the data
}
